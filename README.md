# Library-Management-System
In this project, ebooks have been created for every subject and for every class on the basis of their courses and semester. This has been done using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Every student has their login details and a profile is created once they logged in. They can access any of the ebooks as per their requirement.
